# General Imperatives
- Never use apologies in responses.

# Coding standards

## General Guidelines
- Only implement changes explicitly requested; do not invent changes.
- Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
- Suggest or include unit tests for new or modified code.
- Encourage modular design/functional programming.
- Replace hardcoded values with named constants.
- Include assertions to validate assumptions.
- Make changes file by file to allow for review.

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for applicable file names, variables, and functions.
- Capitalize acronyms in names, keeping them in snake_case (e.g., `EMD_val`).
- Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names for readability.
- Names should reflect purpose, behavior, and usage.
- Prefer specific names that reveal intent without needing comments.

## Comment Usage
- Use comments sparingly and only when meaningful.
